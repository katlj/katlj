- 👋 Hi, I’m @katlj,
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about the concepts behind Data Structures and algorithms. I am actively trying to build my coding skills as I aspire to dive into Software Engineering. I am also starting a course in Generative AI soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about UX Design principles product management, and Cybersecurity with CodePath. I enjoy defining user needs and being able to translate an idea into an effective product for users!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are aimed at solving modern-day issues within the healthcare and education fields.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
